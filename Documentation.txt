In Geffe Cipher
->We used dataset of size of 1 lakh ,the dataset contained 64 bit initial key and 8 bytes of Keystream
->Also performed nist tests on it with tishika
->Used CNN Model to check randomness bias in the genr keystream.

In A5/1 cipher

->we used datset of size 10 lakh,1lakh ,2lakh ,,the dataset contained 64 bit initial key and 10 bytes of Keystream
->Also performed nist tests on it with tishika
->Used CNN Model to check randomness bias in the genr keystream.
We have a CNN model(built by tishka) for 1lakh,2lakh,15 lakh dataset.
